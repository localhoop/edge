// Pure transport-layer logic for the BLE engine — NO flutter_blue_plus, NO I/O.
// Everything here is deterministic and unit-testable without hardware:
//   - the connection-phase state machine + its legacy string projection
//   - the reconnection backoff schedule (bounded exponential + jitter)
//   - the sequence-counter allocators (live high range / sync ACK low range)
//   - the drain stop-condition predicates
//
// Keeping this layer pure makes the race-prone transitions unit-testable
// without a real WHOOP band.

/// early ABORT that stopped the offload before HISTORY_COMPLETE (the cursor never
