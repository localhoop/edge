//   1. Decide WHICH calendar days need compute (force / pending span / latest
//      freshness-critical day).
//   2. Build / refresh the first primitive, `sleep_session_candidates`, from a
//      bounded overlap window only when needed.
//   3. Load the exact calendar-day substrate + exact sleep-window substrate for
//      the target day, then build one PreparedDerivationDay from those pieces.
//   4. Run the pure day pipeline off-isolate, then compute the second
//      primitive, `wake_day_features`, directly from the local-day substrate.
//   5. Persist day_result as the materialized UI surface, plus compact baseline
//      artifacts (`rolling_artifact`, `crossday_input`) for downstream reuse.
//   6. Run cross-day / notifications from those compact artifacts and prune raw
//      only after a force/full-history sweep, never before derived.
//
// Finalized-day rescans are still allowed for baseline-dependent scalars
// (readiness/recovery, illness/anomaly, stress), but they now gate off the
// rolling baseline artifact instead of recomputing the signature ad hoc from
// metric_series each time.

/// Analytics/bundle version — bump to force a recompute of non-finalized days.
/// v3: Walch 2019 stager + 4-class stages (light/deep/rem), robust nocturnal HRV,
/// 0–21 strain, skin-temp-z baseline fix, baseline-need signals.
/// v4: finalization + retention anchored on the DATA EDGE (last drained record
/// timestamp), not the wall clock — a buffer-and-sync band's wall-clock time is
/// irrelevant. Bumping resets per-version finalization so any day the old wall-
/// clock logic prematurely LOCKED (before its flash fully drained) re-derives.
/// v5: sleep HR-dip is confidence-only — no longer relocates onset. Validated on
/// real data: the old trim shoved a true 02:15 onset to 02:41, discarding ~26
/// min of real early sleep. Window onset now stands; stager decides wake within.
/// v6: replaced the Walch ML stager with a transparent cardiorespiratory rule
/// stager (motion + HR + RMSSD vs the night's own baseline). Walch over-called
/// wake (solid night read 60% eff) and ignored RR; the rule stager uses RR and,
/// on real data, lifts a true solid night to ~94–99% eff with a plausible
/// light/deep/REM mix. Honest ESTIMATE (conf scales with RR coverage).
/// v7: CALENDAR-day model (local midnight→midnight) replaces wake-to-wake. A
/// day's sleep = the main sleep that ENDED that morning; recovery follows into
/// the day, strain = that day's waking activity. Deletes the wake-scan day
/// boundaries / 36 h horizon / back-extension; recompute = the calendar day(s)
/// new data touches. Day keys are now plain calendar dates.
/// v8: STRESS (Baevsky SI, windowed median → 0–100 score) + relative SpO₂
/// (overnight desaturation index) now computed, persisted to day_result +
/// metric_series, and surfaced (Today tiles, stress screen, day/week/month/3M
/// trends). Stress validated on real data (SI ~47–52, low/normal resting).
/// v9: ACTIVITY-MINUTES — coarse 1 Hz movement proxy (wrist orientation change;
/// 1 Hz can't do ENMO/steps — Nyquist). Persisted + trended. Validated on real
/// data (~477 active min on a full day). True step counts remain live-IMU only.
/// v10: active calories (Keytel), HR zones, nocturnal nadir/waking, sleep-need
/// 8 h default; activeMin stored as double (fixes the int→double? derive crash).
/// v11: SLEEP CYCLES corrected to Rosenblum 2024 "fractal cycles" (HRV-adapted):
/// peak-to-peak of the smoothed per-minute RMSSD series, NOT categorical REM-
/// episode counting. Validated on real data (4 / 2 cycles, ~90–100 min each).
/// v12: nocturnal nadir INSTANT (`sleeping_hr_nadir_ts`) added so the card shows
/// "NADIR @ HH:MM" instead of "@ -"; seam-side, getDayStrain now routes the
/// cross-day EWMA-ACWR `load` to the strain detail. Full seam↔screen audit.
/// v13: computable gaps filled — HRV stability (CV) + Poincaré irregular-beat
/// screen (pipeline), and engine-injected blocks: wear segments, waking
/// daytime-HRV timeline, nocturnal restlessness, and sleep periods (main+naps).
/// v14: trend scalars for sleep-stage minutes (rem/deep/light/tst) + lf_hf +
/// hrv_cv (→ metric_series); per-5-min day `activity_curve` for the "Your day"
/// timeline. (Peak/lowest-HR + their @times are computed seam-side from the HR
/// curve, no derived change.)
/// v15: efficiency + worn_min scalars → metric_series (sleep-efficiency & wear
/// trends); + _trendKey fixes (resting_hr→rhr, skin_temp→skin_temp_z, sleep→tst_min).
/// v16: ADDITIVE analytics surfaced into the bundle — (a) `clinical.strain_effort`
/// + `scalars.strain_effort`: a 0–100 Edwards zone-sum "effort" strain (Karvonen
/// %HRR over the per-second wake HR) beside the 0–21 headline; (b) top-level
/// `baselines` block: Winsorized-EWMA personal baselines (rhr/hrv/resp) with
/// z/delta/ratio + cold-start status; (c) `advanced_sleep` block: a 4-class
/// Cole–Kripke/DoG stager's main-session AASM metrics + hypnogram (parallel
/// ESTIMATE; the single-source `sleep` block stays the headline). Bumping
/// re-derives non-finalized recent days so the new blocks populate.
/// v17: STEPS (24/7 ESTIMATE = ambulatory-minutes × cadence, personalized by the
/// live 100 Hz pedometer's cadence calibration) + TOTAL DAILY ENERGY (TDEE via
/// HR-flex: Mifflin BMR floor + active Keytel surplus). New scalars `steps` +
/// `calories_total` → metric_series; `steps`/`calories_total` bundle blocks. 1 Hz
/// still can't COUNT steps (Nyquist) — real counts come from live streaming, which
/// also tunes this estimate. Bumping re-derives non-finalized days so they fill.
// v20: principled nap detection (van Hees immobility + HR-dip) → `naps` block +
// `nap_min` scalar; cross-day Sleep Coach (need/bedtime/cycle-wake/performance),
// Strain Coach (recovery-gated target), VO₂max + WHOOP-Age, all in the crossday
// bundle.
// v21: all-day HRV line (`series.hrv_day`, epoch rolling RMSSD over 24/7 RR).
// v22: all-day RESP line (`series.resp_day`, rolling RSA br/min) + relative
// SKIN-TEMP trend (`series.skin_temp_day`) for the Timeline graph.
// v23: all-day HRV (`series.hrv_day`) now rejects ectopic/missed-beat pairs
// (Malik 20% rule) + clips to ≤220 ms, killing the non-physiological 400+ ms
// spikes.
// v24: picks up the analytics sleep-algorithm rewrite (multi-session detection +
// bridging + main-session pick via AdvancedSleepStager). Bumping re-derives
// non-finalized days so past nights restage; "Re-analyze data" restages all.
// v25: 24/7 irregular-rhythm SCREEN (day-span RR → `irregular_rhythm_flag` +
// notification), heart-rate recovery (HRR) per auto-detected bout → `hrr_bpm`,
// breathing-rate variability (`brv_cv`/`brv_slope`), opt-in auto-workout
// SUGGESTIONS (workout_suggestions table + notification), and low-confidence
// WRIST ORIENTATION during sleep (NOT body position). Bumping re-derives
// non-finalized days; "Re-analyze data" restages all.
// v26: integration bump — the oxygen/workout PR externalized active-calorie
// compute to `Calories.activeEnergy` (Keytel + height term) without a version
// bump; combined with the v25 features above, bump so finalized days recompute
// onto the new calorie formula instead of silently carrying the old values.
// v27: WEAR fix — worn-time / coverage / on-off segments were defined as hr>0,
// which misreads daytime PPG drop-out as off-wrist and collapsed a 24 h-worn day
// to ~the sleep window (~7-8 h). Wear is now RECORD presence (gap-detected), in
// both the `worn_min` scalar (onehz_pipeline) and the `_wearBlock` detail. Bump
// so finalized days recompute the corrected wear ("Re-analyze data" restages all).
// v28: SLEEP rescue — manual sleep entry + HR-led fallback. When accel-led
// detection finds nothing, an HR-dip fallback now proposes a window (source
// 'auto_fallback', low confidence); a user can type/confirm a window
// (sleep_override table → source 'manual'/'confirmed') which force-derives even
// a finalized day. Bump so fallback-eligible days restage.
// v29: COUNTER-RESET RECOVERY. The decoded substrate now dedupes by timestamp
// (rec_ts, newest-wins) instead of by the strap counter, which resets on reboot
// and silently quarantined every post-reboot day (empty "today", strain –). The
// DB v17 migration (_rebuildCanonicalDecodedStore) rebuilt decoded_onehz/
// decoded_rr time-keyed, the write path REPLACEs on rec_ts, and the substrate
// loader reads only the canonical decoded substrate. Bump so days derived with
// the earlier incomplete store recompute against the recovered data.
// v32: SLEEP-STAGE fix — the REM detector depended on a respiration signal
// (`resp`) that no real caller ever supplied (WHOOP 4's R24 record has no
// respiration-ADC channel), so it was unconditionally NaN and the primary
// REM rule could never fire — nights collapsed to almost-all-light. Also
// resolved a three-implementation ambiguity (`cardioStager` vs
// `AdvancedSleepStager` v1/v2 — only v1 was ever actually wired, despite
// `cardioStager` being the one documented as fixing Walch 2019's WAKE-bias)
// via a head-to-head comparison; `cardioStager` (StagingMethod.cardio) is now
// the wired default. ALSO in this same (unshipped) bump: `dailyStepEstimate`'s
// doc had always promised a "run of >= minBoutMin consecutive ambulatory
// minutes" bout gate that was never actually implemented — every minute that
// individually passed the ENMO+HR gate summed directly into steps, so a
// handful of scattered, non-contiguous minutes overnight (a brief HR lift
// during a turn-over) could report several thousand phantom steps the moment
// someone woke up having never walked. `minBoutMin` (default 3) is now a real
// gate. Bumping re-derives non-finalized days so past nights/days restage;
// ALREADY-FINALIZED history needs "Re-analyze data" to pick up BOTH corrected
// staging and corrected steps — this is the one bump so far where that's
// worth actually telling users about, since it affects months of history,
// not just going forward.
// v37: SLEEP-STAGE fix #2 (real-device root cause, not synthetic) — v32 fixed
// the dead REM path but a real overnight capture showed cardioStager still
// massively over-called WAKE (~6h on a night truth was ~3min) and under-
// called REM (~40min vs a ~2h42m truth). Root cause: BOTH the motion
// ("gravity 1 g reference") and HR ("sleeping HR baseline") features were
// single WHOLE-NIGHT scalars. This real device's decoded gravity-vector
// magnitude is NOT perfectly orientation-invariant — different STATIC sleep
// postures read up to ~13% apart in |accel| despite near-zero within-epoch
// variance (i.e. genuinely still), so 389/421 "big move" epochs that night
// were this artifact, not real movement, and produced WAKE blocks too long
// for Webster rescore to bridge back. Separately, the whole-night HR arousal
// threshold misread the sleep-onset HR-decay transient (elevated HR for the
// first ~60-90 min while settling) as sustained arousal. `cardio_stager.dart`
// now computes both references as LOCALLY-ADAPTIVE rolling windows, plus a
// local p25 (not median) floor specifically for the REM gate — REM recurs on
// ~90 min ultradian cycles and is a minority of any local window, so a local
// MEDIAN self-dilutes from REM's own periodic elevation. Verified on the real
// capture: wake 294->1 min, light 173->337 min, deep 26->58 min, rem 41->139
// min, against an Apple Watch Ultra ground truth of wake=3 light=330 deep=38
// rem=162 min for the same night. Bump so this genuinely different (much more
// accurate) staging recomputes; "Re-analyze data" needed for finalized nights.
