// headless_boot.dart — Android post-reboot headless auto-connect.
//
// When Android boots the device, BootReceiver starts EdgeTrackingService, which
// causes EdgeApplication.onCreate to pre-warm the FlutterEngine. That engine runs
// main() with no Activity attached. We detect the headless (no-Activity) case here
// and, if a band is paired, start the foreground service + kick a headless sync so
// the band reconnects automatically without user interaction.
//
// Idempotency: EdgeTracking.start() is already idempotent (just sends "start" to
// the existing service). runHeadlessSync() uses a connect-by-id path; if the
// foreground AppState later attaches, it re-uses the same BleEngine and doesn't
// double-connect because BleEngine.connectToRemoteId is guarded by its own state
// machine. The headless sync runs once (await) and then sits idle; the real live
// connection is managed by AppState when the UI opens.
//
// NOT called on iOS — iOS background relaunch is handled by BleRestoreManager +
// IosBleRestore (CB state restoration wake). iOS does NOT have an Activity concept,
// so this Android-only path is guarded by Platform.isAndroid.
